# Odin Nectarine Tutorials - Getting Started
This code demonstrates my way of interacting with any Nectarine bot using Nodejs and Nectarine Dialog API.

The file `secrets.js` contains credentials of its own bot owner. 

The file `apiCaller.js` contains the API calls in order to "talk" to the bot.

The file `index.js` contains the program that talks to the bot.

## Setup
Prerequisites: You should have the latest version of Nodejs and Npm installed. Then:
In the console: `npm install` to install all libraries. 

Warning: Your PC must be connected to the Internet without any proxy. If you encounter any error,
please try to run your console/terminal as administrator.

## Running
In the console: `npm start`
